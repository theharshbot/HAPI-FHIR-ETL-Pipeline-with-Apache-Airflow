# HAPI-FHIR-ETL-Pipeline-with-Apache-Airflow
This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow to process patient data from the HAPI FHIR server. The pipeline extracts patient information, transforms it into a structured format, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database.
